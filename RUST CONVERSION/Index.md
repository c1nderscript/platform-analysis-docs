# RUST CONVERSION Project Index

## Overview

Strategic migration initiative to modernize the Surrentumlabs unified ecosystem (Twitch, Destiny.gg, MemeLabs) through unified Rust backend and TypeScript frontend architecture.

## Migration Objectives

- **50%+ performance improvement** via Rust backend migration
- **95%+ TypeScript coverage** eliminating runtime type errors  
- **70%+ code reuse** through shared component libraries
- **60% technical debt reduction** through modernization
- **30% development velocity increase** post-consolidation

## Components

### Essential Migration Components

- **[[Components/Auth-Service]]** - Authentication service migration to Rust
- **[[Components/Chat-Service]]** - Real-time chat system conversion
- **[[Components/Chat-GUI]]** - Frontend chat interface TypeScript migration
- **[[Components/Video-Pipeline]]** - Video processing pipeline modernization
- **[[Components/Bot-Framework]]** - Moderation and bot framework
- **[[Components/Infra-Platform]]** - Infrastructure platform consolidation

### Cross-Platform Analysis

- **[[../docs/architecture/cross-comparison]]** - Component mapping matrix between platforms
- **[[Strategy/cross-platform-comparison]]** - Detailed migration strategy analysis

## Architecture Goals

### Backend Migration (Rust)
- Memory safety improvements and performance gains
- Async/await patterns for high-concurrency systems  
- Actor model implementations for distributed systems
- Foreign Function Interface (FFI) for gradual migration

### Frontend Migration (TypeScript)
- Progressive typing strategies for legacy JavaScript
- Shared component library architecture
- Build system optimization with Webpack/Vite
- State management patterns unified across platforms

## Navigation

- **[[Coverage]]** - Component tracking and migration progress
- **[[../Index]]** - Main Twitch documentation hub
- **[[../Warp/Tasks]]** - Task management and tracking
- **[[Strategy/]]** - Migration strategy documentation
- **[[Components/]]** - Individual component migration plans

## Status

**Current Phase**: Component Analysis and Migration Planning  
**Progress**: 6/12 essential components analyzed
**Next**: Strategy development and implementation roadmap
